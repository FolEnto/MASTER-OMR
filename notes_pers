Next things to do :

MusicXML generator -> Baseline OCR system -> errors -> evaluation metrics with public poll

1. Errors in image -> find the error in musicXML -> label the type of error
2. Errors in image -> train something to recognise the error 





Python mingus -> Generate music score (can be randomized)
TODO : Generate original MusicXML

Go through Audiveris (OMR)

Compare with source musicXML

TODO : ERROR DETECTION
TODO : PUBLIC POLL
