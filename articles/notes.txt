2001 The challenge of Oprical Music Recognition :
general framework that decomposes the problem of OMR into key stages
difficulty of comparing rival OMR systems, highlighting certain steps that help ease the task.
Properties of Music
2.1. INDIVIDUAL MUSICAL FEATURES
2.2. THE LAYOUT OF MUSICAL FEATURES
-> Ambiguity
2.3. SUPERIMPOSED MUSICAL FEATURES
2.4. MUSIC NOTATION INCLUDES TEXT
Framework :

1 staff line identification
2 musical object location
3 musical feature classification
4 musical semantics

Perhaps the most open question in OMR is how to compare the success and
accuracy of rival OMR systems. Here we recommend, as important steps in this
process, the need for a corpus of musical images and a more detailed breakdown
of an OMR system’s accuracy rates, with errors measured by the number of editing
operations required in an abstract music editor.

Hi Moreno,

For what I've read, there are some good approach to recognise musical symbols, techniques to remove stafflines, but I ommited to take in account exisiting software. Based on my experience, they were not so powerful but I did not research enough, like the solutions on this page https://github.com/topics/optical-music-recognition look very good.

Honnestly, the application is something that I would do even if it is not for the master's thesis.

When you said : "A way of categorizing different pieces based on some “musical” features?"

One interesting thing that I can imagine and can somehow be in the line with what i want to do is to try to guess the intrument for which a sheet is meant by recognising typical musical features. A piano sheet has two staff-lines, a Tuba part as lower notes and way less than a clarinet part.

What even the most recent litterature admits is the lack of a way to measure the errors or the edit distance, as we can weight differently if the note is off pitch, if the accidents (sharps and flat) are not accurate or if the rithm is false. I don't see exactly how I can improve this to have “research-related” novelty, but this could be a track to follow.

If you think that this field too much "solved" I will resolve myself to do something else. The more I read, the less I see something enough deep for my thesis, but I might need to take a step back, based on what you will tell me next.
